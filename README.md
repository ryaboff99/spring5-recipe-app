# Spring Boot Recipe Application

This app is an emulation of a recipe site. It displays recipes with their values on the main (index) page using Hibernate and Thymeleaf. It also contains the h2 database. This application uses the following relationships:

@OneToOne - in Ingredients, Notes, Recipes

@OneToMany - in the Recipe

@ManyToOne - in Ingredients

@ManyToMany - in Category, Recipe


This repository is for an example application built in my Spring Framework 5 - Beginner to Guru
